## Purpose
These are hotkey scripts that I use to perform certain simple actions in games, either to prevent strain on my mouse hand, or for amusement value in sandbox games.
They are intended for my own use, or as a reference for others who wish to do similar things with AutoHotKey.

## Warning
I do not test these scripts anywhere except on my own machine using my own settings, so if anyone else tries to use them, there is a good chance that they will not work correctly.
Since these scripts send keyboard/mouse inputs, they are capable of performing almost any action on your computer (given the right/wrong circumstances.)

## Script Summaries

### _general/turboclick.ahk

Acts similarly to turbo buttons on console controllers.
If Ctrl and either the left or right mouse button are held, rapid mouse clicks will register.
I mainly use this to spam actions in sandbox games, or to work around poorly designed UI elements which require large numbers of clicks to increment a value.

### 7-days-to-die/craft.ahk

Performs repetitive crafting actions which normally cause hand strain.

### rust/music.ahk

Allows notes to be played in tune on the in-game guitar.
